  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <h2>What is sciteit?</h2>
  <p>Read the 
&#32;
<a href="/help/about">about</a>
&#32;
page.</p>
  <h2>Why not just make a sub-reddit?</h2>
  <p>Reddit sub-reddits have a number of undenyable advantages.  They are easy to setup, are hosted on an established and reliable website and their appearance is easy to customize.  However, they are limited to the feature set of reddit.  While reddit has many useful and sophisticated features, the central purpose is somewhat different.  The main task of reddit is to link to, and scrape information from, videos, music, images and the like.  Sciteit is focused on discussion and criticism of scholarly work and as such has a different focus and different needs.  For example, sciteit allows latex to be converted into typeset mathematics in comments, something that could not be done on a subreddit.</p>
  <h2>Sciteit would be so much better if ___.</h2>
  <p>That's probably a good idea.  Please have a look here and see if anyone else has suggested the same thing, if not create a post with your suggestion.</p>
  <h2>What's with the name?</h2>
<p>The primary meaning of sciteit is a trendy contraction of Socially Cited It.  However, sciteit has a number of other meanings:</br>
  <ul>
  <li>It is a hommage to reddit, which is the code on which sciteit is built.</li>
  <li>Scientific Citations</li>
  <li>To a dyslexic, Scientific-e-tit.</li>
  <li>Anything else you care to think of.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>What's with the dinosaur?</h2>
  <p>That's sciteosaurus, the nerdy dinosaur.  He was drawn by my lovely and talented partner.  You may notice a few places where the reddit alien still hasn't been replaced.  If you come across one of these, please 
&#32;
<a href="/feedback">let us know</a>
&#32;
 so we can replace him with sciteosaurus.</p>
