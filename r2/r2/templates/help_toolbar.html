<h2>The Toolbar</h2>
<p>
The toolbar is a useful way to quickly access sciteit, without leaving the page you are reading.  Using it you can vote on a link or view comments, without leaving the article you are reading.  Additionally, you can use the toolbar to quickly submit the page you are reading, if it has not already been submitted to sciteit.</p>
<p>Toolbar links can be autogenerated by prepending http://sciteit.com/ to any URL. For example, if you're visiting the Wikipedia page on the Konami code (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code</a>) and you're wondering if it was ever submitted to sciteit, just go to 
&#32; 
<a href="http://sciteit.com/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code"><b>http://sciteit.com/</b>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code</a>
&#32; 
 (you can leave off either or both "http://"s).</p>
<p>If you do the above, and the link hasn't been submitted, you'll be taken to the submit page. So this is a great shortcut for submitting links to sciteit.</p>
